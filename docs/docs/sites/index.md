## Based on an existing source type

1. Start the program.
2. Click on the "Sources" button at the bottom of a search tab
3. Click on the "Add" button at the bottom of the window that just popped up
4. Fill the Url field, and leave the "Guess" checkbox checked
5. If an error occurs, uncheck "Guess", and choose a source type manually in the list

**⚠️ If Shimmie-based boards are currently supported, a lot of them are still buggy, so beware when using them**


## Create a new source type

If none of the available sources types match the website you want to add, you'll have to create one yourself.

See [this documentation](source.md) for more info.
